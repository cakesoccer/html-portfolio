<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Sarah Espaldon is Head of International at Open Government Products (OGP), an
  experimental tech team within the Singapore government that aims to create an
  open source operating system for governments around the world. By taking the
  best of private sector tech practices to work on public good problems, Open
  Government Products is creating real change from the ground up, reimagining
  how governments can serve its citizens in the digital age. Products they’ve
  built include a COVID-19 vaccination system that enabled a 96% vaccination
  rate across Singapore, an inclusive digital voucher system that’s distributing
  over S$800 million to Singaporeans and revolutionizing how Singapore
  approaches fiscal policy, and an end-to-end encrypted digital form builder
  that is making paper forms obsolete.

  Prior to joining the Singapore government, Sarah worked in brand management
  for Procter & Gamble, driving double digit sales and profit growth in
  Southeast Asia, and NBCNews in New York City where she was a researcher for
  the network’s anchor programmes. She was a U.S. Presidential Scholar and
  previously attended Stanford University where she obtained a degree in
  International Relations.

  In her spare time, Sarah enjoys practicing and teaching Pilates, making her
  own matcha lattes, advocating for the increased distribution of oat milk
  worldwide, and eating until she's satisfied (which is different than eating
  until she is full).
