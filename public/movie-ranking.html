<h1>Sarah's Favorite Movies of ALL TIME</h1>

<h2>The best of the best</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>
  This is the best of the Lord of the Rings and subsequent Hobbit trilogies. It
  has a mixture of action, humor, and heart.
</p>

<h3>Pan's Laberynth</h3>
<p>
  I don't normally like theis kind of movie, but it was just so beautifully done
  with the visuals and the soundtrack that stays with you.

<h3>The Princess Diaries</h3>
<p>This is what dreams are made of. Such a fun, feel-good movie.</p>
